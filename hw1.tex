\section{Gradient descent}

We implemented a basic batch gradient descent procedure and applied it to minimize two different objective functions: the negative Gaussian function and the quadratic bowl function. Furthermore, after creating the implementations, we investigated how our choice of starting guess, step size, and convergence criterion/ threshold impacted our resulting solution. \\

Starting guess: \\

In general we saw that starting guess did not have much of an impact on our resulting solution. If the starting guess was farther away from the actual minimum, it simply took the algorithm a bit longer to actually converge. In the end though, the algorithm would converge for both of our objective functions. To the right you can see graphs with starting guesses of various orders of magnitude. \\

Step size: \\

Throughout our research, we discovered that step size actually had a pretty significant impact on our resulting solutions. For example, a step size that was too large would actually result in our gradient descent algorithm diverging instead of converging. This is illustrated in the figure on the right. As we can see, the algorithm oversteps on the first step which causes the norm of the new gradient to be larger than the original gradient norm. This then proceeds to compound at every step which ultimately causes the algorithm to diverge and go to infinity. \\

Convergence criterion/ threshold: \\

In addition to step size, the convergence criterion also has a pretty significant impact on the resulting solution. In general, we find that accuracy is inversely proportional to the convergence criterion while speed is directly proportional to the convergence criterion, which makes intuitive sense. Basically, with a large convergence criterion, the accuracy of the resulting solution is reduced while the algorithm runs to completion faster. On the other hand, with a smaller convergence criterion, the accuracy of the resulting solution is increased while the algorithm takes much longer to complete. \\

In order to make sure that our gradient functions were correct, we created a numerical gradient function so that we could validate the gradients at various points. To calculate the numerical gradients, we utilized the central difference approximation. For the quadratic bowl, it appears that no matter what the difference step was, the numerical gradient always equaled the true gradient. For the negative gaussian, we discovered that by making the difference step smaller, our numerical gradient gained accuracy and became closer to the true gradient. For example, at the point (0,0), the real gradient is [ -1.44009348e-06,   -1.44009348e-06]. The numerical gradient with a difference step of 100 is [ -1.14032986e-08 , -1.14032986e-08]. With a difference step of 10, the numerical gradient is [ -1.37214353e-06,  -1.37214353e-06]. With a difference step of 1, the numerical gradient is [ -1.43939760e-06,  -1.43939760e-06]. And lastly, with a difference step of 0.1, the numerical gradient is [ -1.44008652e-06,  -1.44008652e-06] (almost identical to the real gradient). From a mathematical perspective this makes intuitive sense because the very definition of a derivative is basically the numerical gradient as the difference step approaches 0. \\

In the next part of our research, we utilize two forms of gradient descent in order to try and minimize the following function: \\
$$J(\theta) = \Sigma_{i}(x^{(i)T}\theta - y^{i})^2$$ \\ 

Like before, we had to be really particular in the convergence criterion and step sizes we chose in order to ensure that the gradient descent converges. For batch gradient descent we chose an initial guess of all $0s$ with a step size of $10^{-6}$ and a convergence criterion of 1. This resulted in a $\theta$ that converged to  [  0.50832359  -2.33986133  -6.31150421   6.80803415  -1.06442692 6.66532056   3.39605963  -0.45908695 -12.94348103  15.73213395], which ultimately gave a minimum $J(\theta)$ of 8343.21291982. \\

In our stochastic gradient descent, we used the Robbins-Monro conditions in order to guarantee convergence. Specifically, we chose a $t$ value of $0.75$ and a $\gamma_{0}$ value of $10^{8}$. In terms of accuracy, it seems that the batch gradient descent is a bit more accurate. In terms of total number of evaluations, it also seems that the batch gradient has less.

\section{Linear basis function regression}

We consider linear basis function regression as a method to benchmark the robustness of the gradient descent solution presented above. By using the closed-form maximum likelihood equation, we can calculate the maximum likelihood weight vector for our list of basis functions to approximate the data in the form of our basis. In this scenario, we are using data generated by $y(x) = \cos(\pi x) + 1.5 \cos(2 \pi x) + \epsilon(x)$, where $\epsilon(x)$ is some added noise to the dataset. Running linear regression on a simple polynomial basis of order $M$, where $\phi_0(x) = x^0$, $\phi_1(x) = x^1$, $\phi_2(x) = x^2$, ..., $\phi_M(x) = x^M$, we calculate the maximum likelihood weight vector by the following:
$$w_{ML} = (\Phi^T \Phi)^{-1} \Phi^T y$$
where $w_{ML}$ is the maximum likelihood weight vector and $\Phi$ is given by:
$$\Phi =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \phi_0(x_0)   & \phi_1(x_0)   & \phi_2(x_0)   & \dots   & \phi_M(x_0) \\
  \phi_0(x_1)   & \phi_1(x_1)   & \phi_2(x_1)   & \dots   & \phi_M(x_1) \\
  \vdots        & \vdots        & \vdots        & \ddots  & \vdots \\
  \phi_0(x_n)   & \phi_1(x_n)   & \phi_2(x_n)   & \dots   & \phi_M(x_n) \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Our choice of $M$, the degree of our polynomial basis, largely determines the fit of the regression to the data (Figure 2). More specifically, as small values of $M$, the polynomial basis cannot adequately capture all the data points. At higher values of $M$ however, overfitting occurs in which the weight vector performs well on the training data, but is not well generalized to new data. The value of $M$ therefore must be carefully considered in order to prevent too high variability in our generated regression polynomial. \\

\end{figure}

We can also instead choose our set of basis functions to be the set of cosine functions, where $\phi_1(x) = \cos(\pi x)$, $\phi_2(x) = \cos(2 \pi x)$, ..., $\phi_M(x) = \cos(M \pi x)$. This is again calculated for multiple values of $M$ and compared in Figure 3. Interestingly, even when we use the same family of basis functions as used to generate the initial data ($M=2$), due to the noise $\epsilon(x)$ added to the initial dataset, the maximum likelihood weight vector does not identically match the actual function used:
$$ w =
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  1.5
\end{bmatrix}$$
$$ w_{MLE} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  0.779 \\
  1.174
\end{bmatrix}$$
where $w$ is the actual weight vector and $w_{MLE}$ is the maximum likelihood estimated weight vector.

\section{Ridge regression}

As illustrated in the previous section, some values of $M$ can result in overfitting to the training set. Thus, in an attempt to reduce overfitting, we implement ridge regression, which adds a regularization parameter $\lambda$ to the regression function. In this case, we have chosen a regularizer to serve as a weight decay, in order to encourage weight vector values to tend towards zero unless otherwise supported by the data. For any given value of $M$ therefore, with greater weight decay regularization coefficients, the weight vector decays more strongly towards zero. In other words, for higher values of $\lambda$, the data must more strongly support greater weight vector values in order to acehive the same magnitude of coefficients in the weight vector. \\ \\
This is illustrated in Figure 4, where the first row illustrates the fit of ridge regression using a polynomial basis of degree 3 with $\lambda = 0.1$ and $1$ and the second row shows the fit of the ridge regression using a polynomial basis of degree 10. As illustrated, the weight vector coefficients in the regression are dampened towards zero with greater values of the regularization coefficient. This is compared with the regression computed with a $\lambda = 0$ to illustrate the decay effect of the regulaization parameter.

\end{multicols}
\caption{Ridge regression for values of M and $\lambda$.}
\end{figure}

Using additional data sets for validation and testing, we can select for the best $M$ and $\lambda$ parameters in our regression model using a polynomial basis. More specifically, for many combinations of values of $M$ and $\lambda$, the maximum likelihood weight vector $w_{MLE}$ was calculated based on the training data set. Through model selection on the validation data set, the best model and optimal values for $M$ and $\lambda$ were chosen based on the evaluation metric. This optimal regression model was then run on the testing data set to evaluate the performance of the model on the new data. The maximum likelihood weight vectors were generated for all $M \in [0, 10]$ and $\lambda \in \{0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.4, 1.5\}$, and this was performed multiple times with data set A as the training data and data set B as the testing data, as well as vice versa. The performance of the regression model was evaluated using the sum of squared errors (SSE) and the mean squared errors (MSE); qualitatively, both evaluation metrics result in the same conclusions, although quantitatively, some additional information can be gleaned from each evaluation metric. \\ \\
When data set A was used as the training data and data set B was used as the testing data, the validation step indicated that $M = 2$ and $\lambda=0.0$ yielded the optimal regression model with a minimum SSE of $2.35$ and a minimum MSE of $0.11$. Running this model on the testing data demonstrated that the regression fit the testing data remarkably well, excepting a single outlier in the testing data. Thus, despite a relatively low MSE of $2.58$ on the testing data, the SSE was $25.75$ due to the significant error in the outlier data point. The training, validation, and testing steps are illustrated in Figure 6, in which the best regression line chosen in model selection is plotted against each data set used for training, validation, and testing, respectively.
